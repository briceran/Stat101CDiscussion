# write pseudocode that would generate a square at
# point (x,y)

sys

# write a function that takes as an argument a complex
# number Z.  Here, Z should be an object with two 
# arguments, (i,j), where i corresponds to the 
# imaginary part and j correspongs to the complex part
# plot values using ggplot2

# 1. learn to create random events 

# 2. learn to create queues of people entering a line
# avg # people coming per day and average service time

# 3. learn to code simulations 

# simulate the Diddy Riese line:  most realistic
# simulation wins.  poisson? exponential?



## simulate dating game 


# write helper functions to help tinder out
# could their matching algorithm improve?

# write function get_max_length:


# DataFest

# have someone on your team learn regular expressions

# have someone learn qplot, have them teach it
# to the group.

# Use this same process for all of these.
# have someone learn a few ML/learning algorithms
# ie glm,random forest, lasso - Stanford machine learning
# Datacamp would be really useful- plug1

# who's the most social - let them get the most sleep
# the night before and lead the presentation


# dont over optimize - wait till the end to implement
# anything crazy

# COMMENT YOUR CODE - google python style guide
